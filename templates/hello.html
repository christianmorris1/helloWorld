        <p> I have eaten many hot dogs in my day, but no hot dog will
            ever taste as good as a Fenway frank. They are the best on planet Earth. </p>

    <!-- This is my first comment. I have inputted a header and some introductory paragraph information thus far. -->

    <p> <strong> Tom Brady </strong> and the <strong> New England Patriots </strong> led the league in playoff wins,
        regular season wins, and <em> 6 super bowl wins </em> over the 20 years he spent with
            the team. No other football dynasty has come close. </p>

    <p> A list of  my favorite boston sports athletes since 2000:</p>

        <li> The UMD alarm test every Wednesday </li>
        <li> Construction on campus </li>
        <li> Maryland basketball (sometimes) </li>

    </ol>

    <p> Time to make a table of some of my Smith School Courses: </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th> Course taken </th>
            <th> Semester completed </th>
